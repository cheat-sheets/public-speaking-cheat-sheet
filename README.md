# Public Speaking Cheat Sheet

## Rhetoric

**Rhetoric** is the art of discourse, wherein a writer or speaker strives to inform, persuade or motivate particular 
audiences in specific situations. It is the art of identifying communication needs and strategically responding to them.

### Rhetorical Canons

The rhetorical canons are a set of tools you can apply to preparing and performing speeches.

- **Invention**: Coming up with content

- **Arrangement**: Putting it in an order for an audience of listeners.

- **Style**: Finding the most effective language.

- **Memory**: Getting your speech into your head to support good delivery.

- **Delivery**: Performing the content effectively for this audience.

Speaking and writing are different mediums:

- Language is acquired; writing is learned.
- Language evolved; writing was invented.
- Language is ubiquitous; writing is not.
  
So, write speeches for the ear, not the eye.

Listeners need cues to easily and quickly decode talk:

- Contextual cues provide situational information.
- Prosodic cues (pitch, rate, etc.) provide auditory information.

#### Invention

**Argument** is a claim with warranted support:

- Claim: an assertion that you want the audience to take as valid.
- Support: evidence used to validate your claim.
- Warrant: What links the support to the claim.

Patterns to use to come up with arguments:

- Short term/long term
- Past/present/future
- Increase/decrease
- Cause/effect
- Division
- Definition 

**Support** should show validity and provide details.
- Facts and statistics
- Examples and testimony
- Metaphors and analogies

Generally, aim for a diversity of support types.
 

#### Arrangement

- **Subordination**: all your key points relate to the topic.
- **Coordination**: key points work well together.
- **Discreteness**: key points shouldn't overlap.

#### Style

- Craft short phrases
- Use evocative words
  - My organization *investigates* biomedical industries.
  - We can *equip* people to be better consumers.
  - We *push* for industry improvements to make patient treatments easier.
- Put the key terms in important positions
- Use parallel phrasing

#### Memory

Practice your speech 3-7 times.

#### Delivery

**PSA (Public Speaking Apprehension)** -  is a communication-based anxiety where speakers, in response to an actual 
or expected presentation, experience physiological, cognitive, and behavioral responses.

Causes:

- We misinterpret our body’s signals.
- We misremember what happened.
- We misperceive what the audience saw.

How to reduce PSA:

- Systematic desensitization. Picture yourself in different speaking situations.
- Visualization. See yourself doing well in each of the four stages of speaking: anticipation, 
confrontation, adaptation, and release.
- Cognitive modification. Try to evaluate your fears.
- Practicing. You gotta log in the hours of practice.

**What to focus on for good delivery**:

- Breath control: we need a good volume of air, diaphragmatic breathing can help.
- Projection: try to expand the pharynx to add to your resonance, 
- Pitch: maintain good contrastive tone.
- Rate and pauses: deliver important lines more slowly, use pauses and repetition to direct attention.
- Gestures: have controlled gestures, use gestures to augment and emphasize the content.
- Movement: be committed; your movement shouldn’t look unconscious; rather, more purposefully.
