# Public Speaking Cheat Sheet

## Rhetoric

**Rhetoric** is the art of discourse, wherein a writer or speaker strives to inform, persuade or motivate particular 
audiences in specific situations. It is the art of identifying communication needs and strategically responding to them.

### Rhetorical Canons

The rhetorical canons are a set of tools you can apply to preparing and performing speeches.

- **Invention**: Coming up with content

- **Arrangement**: Putting it in an order for an audience of listeners.

- **Style**: Finding the most effective language.

- **Memory**: Getting your speech into your head to support good delivery.

- **Delivery**: Performing the content effectively for this audience.

Speaking and writing are different mediums:

- Language is acquired; writing is learned.
- Language evolved; writing was invented.
- Language is ubiquitous; writing is not.
  
So, write speeches for the ear, not the eye.

Listeners need cues to easily and quickly decode talk:

- Contextual cues provide situational information.
- Prosodic cues (pitch, rate, etc.) provide auditory information.

#### Invention

**Argument** is a claim with warranted support:

- Claim: an assertion that you want the audience to take as valid.
- Support: evidence used to validate your claim.
- Warrant: What links the support to the claim.

Patterns to use to come up with arguments:

- Short term/long term
- Past/present/future
- Increase/decrease
- Cause/effect
- Division
- Definition 

**Support** should show validity and provide details.
- Facts and statistics
- Examples and testimony
- Metaphors and analogies

Generally, aim for a diversity of support types.
 

#### Arrangement

- **Subordination**: all your key points relate to the topic.
- **Coordination**: key points work well together.
- **Discreteness**: key points shouldn't overlap.

#### Style

- Craft short phrases
- Use evocative words
  - My organization *investigates* biomedical industries.
  - We can *equip* people to be better consumers.
  - We *push* for industry improvements to make patient treatments easier.
- Put the key terms in important positions
- Use parallel phrasing

#### Memory

Practice your speech 3-7 times.

#### Delivery

**PSA (Public Speaking Apprehension)** -  is a communication-based anxiety where speakers, in response to an actual 
or expected presentation, experience physiological, cognitive, and behavioral responses.

Causes:

- We misinterpret our body’s signals.
- We misremember what happened.
- We misperceive what the audience saw.

How to reduce PSA:

- Systematic desensitization. Picture yourself in different speaking situations.
- Visualization. See yourself doing well in each of the four stages of speaking: anticipation, 
confrontation, adaptation, and release.
- Cognitive modification. Try to evaluate your fears.
- Practicing. You gotta log in the hours of practice.

**What to focus on for good delivery**:

- Breath control: we need a good volume of air, diaphragmatic breathing can help.
- Projection: try to expand the pharynx to add to your resonance, 
- Pitch: maintain good contrastive tone.
- Rate and pauses: deliver important lines more slowly, use pauses and repetition to direct attention.
- Gestures: have controlled gestures, use gestures to augment and emphasize the content.
- Movement: be committed; your movement shouldn’t look unconscious; rather, more purposefully.
            
## Presentation Slides

- Don’t use your slides as your notes.
- Don’t confuse your slides as a form of publishing.
- Keep slides simple.
- Limit the text and elements.
- Focus on one or two concepts per slide.
- Break up dense slides into multiple slides.

## Persuasion

**Persuasion** - the deliberate attempt to affect audience beliefs and behaviors through communication. This definition 
implies that audiences have free choice to accept or reject our persuasion. Persuasion thus differs from force and 
coercion. Influence is a broader category that includes factors that lie beyond our deliberate control.

Good persuasion requires careful planning:

- Begin by assessing the board. Where is movement possible? Where is it blocked?
- Identify audience predispositions. Where and how do audience members agree or disagree?
- Identify your target audience. Who do you most want to reach?
- Identify realistic speech objectives. Given their predispositions, how do you want that target audience to move?

Aristotle’s three proofs:

- **Logos** - an appeal to logic, or something that seems logical.
- **Pathos** - an appeal to emotions.
- **Ethos** - an appeal to credibility.

### Ethos

**Ethos** is the performance of your credibility on an issue. Ethos is a long-term strategy aimed at making you 
generally trustworthy. 

Ethos involves:

- **arete** / **excellence** - when speakers demonstrate their arete/excellence/dynamism they exemplify a valued 
trait (passion, commitment, etc.)
- **phronesis** / **practical wisdom** - allows an experienced person to strike upon the right course of action.
Including lots of examples can help show depth of experience. Avoiding jargon can help show depth of understanding. 
- **eunoia** / **goodwill** - showing that you have the audience’s interests in mind. 
You have good will towards the audience.
